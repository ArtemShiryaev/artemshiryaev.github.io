Hello, I am Artem!

Here I intend on posting interesting projects data science I'm working on. I mainly use R and currently trying to refine my python skills through Kaggle projects. If you wish to get in contact with me, send me a mail or lets connect on Linkedin!

The idea is to use this website to record through these projects my own progress, and give other people tips and tricks that have helped me out.
